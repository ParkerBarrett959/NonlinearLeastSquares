# Nonlinear Least Squares Solver
A small C++ header-only library and example executables for solving single-input single-output nonlinear least squares problems. The library includes support for Gradient Descent, Gauss-Newton and Levenberg-Marquardt solver and a simple interface for defining and solving your own nonlinear functions.

# Dependencies
* C++ 11 (or greater) <br />
* CMake (3.22.0 or greater) <br />
* Eigen (3.3 or greater) <br />
# Build
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
# Run Example
To modify the solver options and parameters, modify ```include/SolverOpts.h```. After building, run the examples with
```
# Run example 1
./example1
```
